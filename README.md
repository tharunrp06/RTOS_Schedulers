# RTOS_Schedulers
This repository provides implementations of task schedulers for Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS). Each scheduler is a template, where tasks can be added with attributes like execution time, priority, deadlines, or periods. The goal is to enable easy switching between strategies and show how tasks behave under different policies.
